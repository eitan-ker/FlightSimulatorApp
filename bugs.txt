BUGS

opened:

* what happens when cordinates are invalid? ia it ok to print non stop "ivalid"? or should terminate?
* when joystick is moving in some direction and keep on it, the app only sends the X and Y of the joystick only once 

fixed:
* the application allows to play with sliders while not connected to simulator
* Get\set values from simulator after more than  10 sec
* Replace pushpin icon to plane
* if value's from simulator are incorrect than print ERR instead of value in the appropriate position
* if cordinates are out side of map  - deal with it.
* check throtlle and aileron if they work
* initializing mainWindow does not suppose to show problem with map
